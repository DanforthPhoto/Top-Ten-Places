<a name="1-the-distillery-district" class="anchor" href="#1-the-distillery-district"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. The Distillery District</h2>

<p>I chose the Distillery District as one of my top ten places in the city because I believe it has a very unique atmosphere. I've walked around it with family and friends many times, and I always can appreciate the huge amount of art residing in the buildings, and the awesome festival opportunities there, such as the Weihnacht's Markt in the winter. I believe the Distillery District to be one of the coolest areas in the city, with possibly some of the most interesting buildings as well.</p>

<h2>
<a name="2-the-stlawrence-market" class="anchor" href="#2-the-stlawrence-market"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. The St.Lawrence Market</h2>

<p>I chose the St.Lawrence Market for my top ten list because it's such a good place to go and eat. There are always people there, and there's an appealing environment of hustle and bustle. The rows and rows of food always make me hungry, and there are so many different kinds of foods and drinks to have. I find the market to be quite visually pleasing as well, with its high roof and industrial-era construction.</p>

<h2>
<a name="3-the-harbourfront" class="anchor" href="#3-the-harbourfront"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. The Harbourfront</h2>

<p>The Harbourfront makes it onto my top ten list because it might be the one place in Toronto I've visited the most. I used to always go with my family to see shows or musical performances, and now I go with my friends and skate or walk around the area. It can't be forgotten that it's one of the best places around to see ships, and just watching the lake traffic can be interesting. It provides a home for various forms of wildlife, and also is the most commonly used way to visit the Toronto Islands.</p>

<h2>
<a name="4-the-cn-tower" class="anchor" href="#4-the-cn-tower"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4. The CN Tower</h2>

<p>The CN tower is what most people think of when it comes to Toronto's prominent buildings, or Toronto's architecture. What I like about the tower is that is visible from almost anywhere in Toronto, and I tried to illustrate the point with a few pictures of the Tower from different angles and neighbourhoods. I think the tower is a very impressive building and I like to visit it.</p>

<h2>
<a name="5-kensington-market" class="anchor" href="#5-kensington-market"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5. Kensington Market</h2>

<p>Kensington Market is without doubt one of the most vibrant areas in the city. Unfortunately, at the time I was out taking pictures, it was a bit cold for crowds to be present, but in the summer the market is almost always full with people, art, performances, and the smell of street food. It borders on several other impressive areas (Chinatown, the University) and there's just so much culture in the Market.</p>
